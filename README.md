# SOC Injector: AI Security Research Project

**Classification:** TLP:WHITE - Public Disclosure  
**Research Type:** Offensive Security Research for Defensive Purposes  
**Publication Date:** January 2025

## Executive Summary

This repository exposes critical attack vectors targeting AI-powered Security Operations Centers (SOCs). Our research demonstrates how adversaries can weaponize prompt injection techniques to bypass detection, suppress alerts, exhaust resources, and exfiltrate sensitive data from production SOC environments.

**Key Attack Vectors Identified:**
- **8 Distinct Attack Vector Categories** with working proof-of-concepts
- **AI Resource Exhaustion DDoS** attacks causing service degradation
- **Covert data exfiltration** via malicious markdown injection
- **Alert suppression** techniques enabling persistent threat actor presence
- **Token bombing** attacks leading to significant cost escalation

This research provides the cybersecurity community with actionable intelligence on emerging AI-specific attack techniques and their tactical implementation against SOC infrastructure.

## üö® Attack Capabilities Demonstrated

### Successful Attack Scenarios
- **Complete Alert Suppression:** Critical incidents bypassed through prompt injection, enabling APT persistence
- **SOC Data Exfiltration:** Sensitive threat intelligence stolen via embedded malicious links
- **AI Infrastructure DDoS:** Resource exhaustion attacks degrading entire SOC response capabilities
- **Cost Amplification:** Token bombing resulting in $1,000-$10,000+ unexpected charges

### Highest Impact Attack Vectors
1. **AI Resource Exhaustion/DDoS** - Complete SOC AI infrastructure compromise
2. **Direct Log Manipulation** - Real-time alert suppression during active intrusions
3. **Information Exfiltration** - Covert exfiltration of SOC playbooks and threat intelligence
4. **Threat Intelligence Poisoning** - Contamination of external IOC feeds and threat databases
5. **Email-Based Injection** - Mass distribution of weaponized prompts across enterprise

2. **Network-Based Vectors** - HTTP header manipulation, DNS poisoning, URL parameter injection
3. **Email-Based Vectors** - SMTP header injection, HTML smuggling, tracking pixel exploitation
4. **Malware/Script-Based** - PowerShell comment injection, process name manipulation, registry key attacks
5. **Binary/Resource-Based** - PE resource section exploitation, source code comment injection
6. **Web-Based Vectors** - HTML meta tag injection, CSS steganography, JavaScript variable manipulation
7. **Information Exfiltration** - Malicious markdown link injection for data theft, threat intelligence poisoning via VirusTotal/OSINT sources
8. **AI Resource Exhaustion/DDoS** - Token bombing, recursive analysis loops, memory exhaustion attacks

## üìä Threat Assessment

### High-Risk Target Environments
- **Production SOC AI systems** processing untrusted log sources
- **Automated alert triage platforms** with markdown rendering capabilities
- **Threat intelligence platforms** ingesting external IOC feeds (VirusTotal, OSINT forums)
- **Cost-sensitive cloud deployments** without AI resource monitoring and rate limiting

### Attack Impact Analysis
- **Direct costs:** $1,000-$10,000+ from token bombing and resource exhaustion
- **Operational impact:** Complete SOC analysis capability degradation
- **Security impact:** Undetected APT persistence through alert suppression
- **Intelligence loss:** Exfiltration of SOC playbooks, IOCs, and threat intelligence
- **Trust degradation:** Compromised external threat intelligence sources affecting multiple organizations
